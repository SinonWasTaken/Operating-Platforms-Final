1). Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a company that has created an android application call Draw It or Lose It. They want their game to be web based and they want to bring their game over to other platforms, such as Windows or IOS.
  
2). What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I can't say I did anything particularly well.

3). What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Being able to clearly lay out what needs to be done is the best way for me to understand what needs to be done. You could tell me I need to do this and that, but I won’t truly understand until it is laid and in front of my eyes.

4). If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I am not the best writer, so I would probably redo the entire document, give more information, and present it in more understandable way.

5). How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
	The user is the one using the app, so obviously their needs need to be considered. If the user can’t reliably use a piece of software, then they simply won’t use it. If there aren’t any users using a piece of software, then there was no reason for the software made in the first place.

6). How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
	I didn’t do anything special. I took into account what I needed to accomplish and did my best to make it happen.
